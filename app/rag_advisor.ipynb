You will help them transition successfully into their second year, after which they may be reassigned to a new advisor based on their major or department.\\n\\n10. **Record Keeping**: Advisor assignments are made official in Self Service Banner following each SOAR session, so ensure that you keep accurate records and maintain communication with your advisees.\\n\\nBy keeping these points in mind, you can effectively support your freshman advisees as they navigate their first year of college.'\n"

Signs of Distress: Be alert to the signs that indicate students are in distress and know the proper interventions to assist them.\\n\\n4. Academic Policies: Familiarize yourself with the academic policies and procedures that pertain specifically to first-year students, as these will guide your advising sessions.\\n\\n5. Professional Development: Engage in continuous professional development to stay informed about current trends in academic advising, retention efforts, and changes in university policies and procedures that impact your advisees.\\n\\n6. Generational Differences: Understand the characteristics of the Millennial Generation and Generation Z, and consider how these generational differences may affect advising.\\n\\n7. Major Requirements: Learn about the specific major requirements, particularly for prominent programs such as Elementary Education, Secondary Education, the College of Business, and the College of Nursing.\\n\\n8. Diversity of Students: Be knowledgeable about the specific needs and requirements of diverse subpopulations of first-year students, such as those in DDEP and Pre-engineering.\\n\\nBy keeping these points in mind, you will be better equipped to serve as an anchor for first-year students and help them transition successfully into their second year and beyond.'"
